# Exercise "Implementing Properties"

## Basics on Property Modeling Approaches

The following two figures show two different problems in modeling dynamic properties. Interpret each figure and try to identify which property type is modeled.

## Implementing the core API of the property pattern

### -- Preperations --

Please download the following `.zip`-File. It provides the basic structure of a Java Project implementing the concepts of the property pattern. Import/open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g. IntelliJ, Eclipse).

1. Try to get familiar with the class structure provided by the project. Try to understand the different relationships. Especially take a look at the class `HashMapProperties.java` which represents a concrete implementation of a Property List. It implements the Interface `Properties` which provides the core API of the Property Pattern.  

2. Class `HashMapProperties.java`: Implement the `put`-Method to add new properties to the HashMap.  

Hints: 
* Remind yourself that there can be a link to a parent HashMap (`PARENT`). Make sure the new value doesn't take it's value or doesn't match the Type of 'Properties'.
* Take a look at the `has`-Method - it is already implemented and can help you in understanding 

3. Class `HashMapProperties.java`: Implement the `get`-Method to retrieve a property by it's name from the HashMap.

      Hint:
* Try to think about the two possible cases, where the given property can be located.

3. Adding a property to the project
